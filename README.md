### Context

This repository was built to address the need statement "Car enthusiasts need a
helpful assistant to inform their opinion on the valuation of a second-hand car"

It is paired with a jupyter notebook explaining our observations and user study,
which provides a more detailed insight into what our hypotheses were and what
observations we've come across.

A single user can view their change in valuation and confidence at the end of
the experiment.

### Setting up the repository

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
